# converter21
A music21-based music notation file format converter CLI app, and some new sub converter plug-ins

My initial goal here is to make a really accurate (and thorough) Humdrum importer and exporter for music21.

The Humdrum portion of this software is derived/translated from the C++ code in https://github.com/craigsapp/humlib, by Craig Stuart Sapp.
