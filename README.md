# converter21
A music21-extending converter package that contains alternate music21 Humdrum and MEI converters (a Humdrum parser/writer, and a MEI parser).  converter21 is also a command line tool for conversion between various music notation file formats.

The Humdrum portion of this software is derived/translated from the C++ code in [humlib](https://github.com/craigsapp/humlib), by Craig Stuart Sapp.

The core of the MEI portion of this software was based on the MEI converter in [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertlab/music21), by Michael Scott Asato Cuthbert.

## Setup
Depends on [music21](https://pypi.org/project/music21) v8.1, which should also be configured (instructions [here](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_01_installing.html)) to display a musical score (e.g. with Musescore). Some of the tests depend on [musicdiff](https://pypi.org/project/musicdiff), but converter21 itself does not.

## Command line tool usage:
```
python3 -m converter21 [-h]
                       [-f from_format]
                       -t to_format
                       [-c]
                       input_file output_file

Positional arguments:
  input_file            input music file to convert from (extension is used to determine input
                        format if --input-from/-f is not specified)
  output_file           output music file to convert to (extension is NOT used to determine or
                        validate output format, so if you're not careful you'll end up with
                        contents not matching the extension)

Named arguments:
  -h, --help            show help message and exit
  -f, --input-from {humdrum,musicxml,mei,abc...}
                        format of the input file (only necessary if input file has unsupported or
                        incorrect extension)
  -t, --output-to {humdrum,musicxml,lilypond,braille...}
                        format of the output file (required)
  -c, --cached-parse-ok
                        use music21's cached parse of the input file if it exists
```

## API usage:

See `converter21/__main__.py` (the source code for the command line tool) for an example of how to get music21 to use converter21's alternate Humdrum and MEI converters in your own code.
