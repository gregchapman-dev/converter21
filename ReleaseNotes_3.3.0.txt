Changes since 3.2.0:
    Humdrum export: At start of export, fix up various duration problems (seen e.g. after
        import of a Photoscore-generated MusicXML file) that would prevent Humdrum export
        from succeeding.

    Humdrum/MEI export: There are a lot of custom attributes that we add to various objects
        in the score to keep track of export status.  Remove them at end of export.

    MEI export: Put xml:id on (almost) everything in the exported MEI file.
    MEI export: Clean up ChordSymbol support.
    MEI export: There is no 'heavy-light' barline in MEI.  Rather than fail when we try to
        export one, just export a normal barline.
    MEI export: If voice.id is a string, put it in layer@label, not layer@n (which must be a
        number).

    Shared: SplitComplexRestDurations can now handle rests that have a different visual and
        gestural duration (in music21 terms, these are rests with an unlinked duration).

    Shared: M21Utilities has a lot more stuff in it now.  Some is moved from other places in
        converter21, so it can be shared with other parts of converter21 (or even with clients),
        and some is new (like the new fixupBadDurations API, used by the Humdrum exporter; see
        above).

    All: lots of little bugfixes.
