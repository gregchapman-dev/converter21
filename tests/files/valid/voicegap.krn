!! The '8C\' on the next line is started at time=3 (3 quarter notes), which is wrong.  It should
!! not be started at the end of '2.G/', but rather somewhere in the middle of it (time=1).  But
!! HumdrumFileStructure::prepareDurations() doesn't put the right durSum value in the reservoir,
!! since durSum is already set to 3 due to '2.G/'s token duration.
