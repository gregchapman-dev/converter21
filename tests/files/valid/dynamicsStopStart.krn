!! weird case where the wedge ends on the first beat of a measure so you should
!! choose the last note in the previous measure (and we don't, we make a 0-length
!! rest), combined with two other problems: (1) the last note in the previous
!! measure is a suppressed tremolo note, and (2) we put it in the measure containing
!! the start wedge anyway (sigh).
